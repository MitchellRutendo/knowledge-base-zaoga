1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,670
Previously on Reacher...

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,090
Susan Duffy, meet Angel Doll.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,970
Thanks for the hand, Angel Doll.

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,050
- McCabe's the one who kidnapped you?\N- Yeah.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,970
You ever hear McCabe or your dad\Nuse the name Xavier Quinn?

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,180
Not that I can remember.

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,100
Beck confirmed McCabe\Nis running this whole thing.

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,060
That's got to be\NJulius McCabe, right?

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,440
I know him as Xavier Quinn.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,640
The guy you thought was dead?

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,110
The guy I thought I killed.\NHow's the bodyguard?

12
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,650
We patched him up,\Ntook a few runs at him,

13
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,940
- but he's not saying shit.\N-  Got a call from McCabe.

14
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,200
He sent someone over to Bizarre Bazaar\Nto get Angel Doll's laptop back,

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,620
because it had a tracking app on it\Nin case it was lost or stolen.

16
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,580
Here's the address.

17
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,330
Anyone inside ain't supposed to be?\NWe kill them.

18
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,380
-  Yeah?\N- Eliot, is Duffy with you?

19
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,470
- Uh, no.\N-  Come on, man,

20
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,590
I want to play the Feud.

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,970
Come on... hey, asshole!

22
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,760
She and Villanueva left me here\Nto babysit again

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,470
while they check out some lead.

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,480
A rug and tubing facility.

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,770
Why? Everything okay?

26
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,230
Quinn's men are looking\Nfor Angel Doll's laptop.

27
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,560
They'll be on them any minute,\Nand no one's answering their phones.

28
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,320
Shit. I-I'll look up the name\Nof the company and call them.

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,030
Get it done.

30
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,890
It's like every 20 minutes with you.

31
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,810
Get that thing checked.

32
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,020
I did.

33
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,020
They put me on the Flomax\Nand the what-do-you-call-it?

34
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,030
The saw palmetto.

35
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,610
Well, up your dosage.

36
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,490
I'd rather not talk about this.

37
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,620
I'd rather not be constantly held up\Nby your mango-sized prostate.

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,160
Why would someone be\Ncalling here when it's closed?

39
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,580
Maybe leaving a message.

40
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,960
It's a commercial shop.

41
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,670
People don't just pop in here to buy shit.

42
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,630
You do business with this place,\Nyou know the hours.

43
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,220
Our cells don't work in here.

44
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,350
Something's off. I'm answering.

45
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,730
Tubing.

46
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,860
Get out of there now.\NQuinn sent people over.

47
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,130
We got to move or we're dead.

48
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,220
He's the last one.

49
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,770
It'll look suspicious if there's\Nanother ambush and I'm the only survivor.

50
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,400
Head to the south exit.

51
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,860
When you get close,\Nyell for Villanueva to follow.

52
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,530
I'll make sure you get out.

53
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,360
They're tracking Angel Doll's laptop.\NWhere is it?

54
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,110
In the car.

55
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,780
When you drive away,\Nthrow it out the window.

56
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,990
Go.

57
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,190
South exit. Let's get out of here!

58
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,000
Shit.

59
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,470
Get rid of it!

60
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,970
Get in.

61
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,520
Who the fuck are you?

62
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,730
Duke's replacement.

63
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,560
Go!

64
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,610
Go!

65
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,580
Tires are stuck.

66
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,040
- We're gonna have to push her out.\N- Goddamn it.

67
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,100
Our competitors don't hire\Nwomen and old guys.

68
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,310
And one of them had a Glock 26 Gen3.

69
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,560
Those are government issued.

70
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,850
I'm telling you, these are federal agents.

71
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,980
Okay.

72
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,820
Cop--

73
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,320
Jesus.

74
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,910
Boss is pissed like a copperhead.\NThis ain't good.

75
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,540
This ain't good at all.

76
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,550
Salud.

77
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,010
What are we celebrating here?

78
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,520
After today? How about breathing?

79
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,640
We didn't find Teresa.\NWe should still be looking.

80
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,980
I get it, and we will.

81
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,190
- But I also need you to be...\N- To be what?

82
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,610
- Nothing.\N- Say it.

83
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,570
I'm not saying shit.

84
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,910
Remember that Menjivar kid?

85
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,200
Four years old,\Ndisappeared from his backyard,

86
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,990
everyone figured some chomo did him in.

87
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,910
Mija, this is a different kind of case.

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,120
Bullshit. Missing's missing.

89
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,580
No one in Boston PD thought\Nthat kid was coming home

90
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,630
in anything other than a box.

91
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,380
By Thanksgiving,\Nthe news stopped covering it,

92
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,920
the parents gave up,

93
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,180
had a funeral with an empty coffin\Nat St. Joachim's,

94
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,260
then what happens?

95
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,840
Connor Lafferty.

96
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,720
Old man fucking Lafferty walks\Nlittle Marco Menjivar

97
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,350
right into Salesbury's for an ice cream,\Nlike any other day.

98
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,730
I still remember the order:

99
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,730
rocky road and a Diet Dr Pepper.

100
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,360
This isn't a case of some sweet\Nold man with Alzheimer's

101
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,820
that took a kid home\Nthinking it was his grandson.

102
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,280
The guys that grabbed Teresa\Nare major league.

103
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,570
My point is, odds get beat.

104
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,490
Marco Menjivar was\Nmissing for nine months.

105
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,500
Statistics said his body was\Nrotting in a landfill or an oil drum,

106
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,460
and he wasn't even hurt!

107
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,750
He was fed, he watched cartoons,\Ngot taken care of.

108
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,920
Now he's 14, hardly remembers it,

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,250
kid was all-county wide receiver

110
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,380
- last season.\N- Tight end.

111
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,680
All I'm saying is that good shit\Ncan still happen.

112
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,390
So either stay on board and believe\Nsome of the good is coming our way,

113
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,890
believe that odds get beat,\Nor shut up about it.

114
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,230
Okay.

115
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,650
Let's get back to work.

116
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,820
Fuck.

117
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,630
Hey, Paulie.

118
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,750
We got a little "Neptune Society"\Nthing going on.

119
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,920
You want to give us a hand?

120
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,430
Okay, then.

121
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,660
Pick him up, tough guy.

122
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,670
There we go.

123
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,920
I threw a living, breathing guy\Ndown here once.

124
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,630
Paulie broke his spine.

125
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,090
Poor bastard couldn't walk.

126
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,590
While we were waiting for the wave,

127
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,470
he was begging me to shoot him\Ninstead of letting him drown.

128
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,100
What'd you do?

129
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,400
I let him drown.

130
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,070
Bombs away.

131
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:31,000
Hey, yo! Look at that. Nature's toilet.

132
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,380
Tide comes in strongest this time of day.

133
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,470
Pulls everything in that cove\Nout like a vacuum.

134
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,720
Undertow's brutal.

135
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,180
Let's go get the other one.

136
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,780
You don't seem to be too broken up\Nabout your pals getting killed.

137
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,790
They ain't my pals. They're cannon fodder.

138
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,250
Warm bodies to do the things\NMcCabe needs done when he needs them done.

139
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,130
He pulls them in from all over...

140
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,300
dishonorable discharges from the service,

141
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,720
guys tossed from the police academy\Nfor failing the psych eval, ex-cons,

142
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,260
the chronically antisocial and unhirable.

143
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,850
No offense.

144
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,600
What category do you fall into?

145
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,440
I'm like Tony Soprano.

146
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,860
I'm in waste management.

147
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,660
That shit never gets old.

148
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,540
What will you do if the tide\Ndoesn't clean up your mess?

149
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,500
These rips could pull\Na Clydesdale out to sea.

150
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,460
I know these currents\Nlike the back of my hand.

151
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,420
Speaking of the back of your hand,\NI just realized who you are.

152
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,180
Duke told me about you.

153
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,220
You're the one that made Paulie\Nknock himself out.

154
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,720
Not out. Just down.

155
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,140
Either way, Paulie's gonna fuck you up.

156
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,270
Better be careful.

157
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,730
Why do you give a shit?

158
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,940
I don't.

159
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,530
I just don't want to have\Nto drag your big ass down here.

160
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,990
It's not like I get paid by the pound.

161
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,250
Reacher.

162
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,670
Yeah. You guys okay?

163
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,800
We're good.

164
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,510
Thanks for saving my ass today.

165
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,590
I owe you.

166
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,100
Saving the life of a good person\Nis a pretty low bar for praise.

167
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,390
Next moves?

168
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,520
Villy's back at the cabin getting his car.

169
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,390
We're gonna split up to cover more ground,

170
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,400
check on some of the addresses\Nfrom Angel Doll's laptop.

171
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,190
You wrote 'em down?

172
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,230
Why would I do that?\NThey were on a laptop.

173
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,730
Good point.

174
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,900
No, we remembered about five of them.

175
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,320
I'm gonna hit a place\Nthat makes storage crates.

176
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,990
Figure they use them to move the rugs.

177
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,830
Villy's gonna run down\Nsome kind of industrial lubricant plant.

178
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,750
I have no idea what that's for,\Nbut from what I could find online,

179
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,830
it looks like a legit operation that Quinn\Nmight buy product from, for some reason.

180
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,170
His guys could be waiting for you

181
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,800
now that Quinn knows\NFeds are snooping around.

182
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,510
We've got no choice.

183
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,720
Their location's been compromised,\Nso they'll have to move Teresa.

184
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,930
If we're lucky,\Nmaybe we catch 'em in the act.

185
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,810
And if we do, I'm taking 'em out.

186
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,470
Sounds like a plan.

187
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,310
- Anything else?\N- Yeah.

188
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,900
I have your badge.

189
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,520
Shit. I didn't notice I'd lost it.

190
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,570
Uh, give it back to me\Nnext time I see you.

191
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,400
Reacher!

192
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,780
I got to go.

193
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,530
Reacher, where the hell are you?

194
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,790
What the hell were you doing behind there?

195
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,080
Had to take a piss.

196
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,250
I have nine bathrooms inside this house.

197
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,330
Yeah, but I was outside.

198
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,550
I just got a call from McCabe.\NWere those guys really Feds?

199
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,340
Not sure.\NHarley got a better look than I did.

200
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,970
Well, McCabe sent\Ntwo of his men over here.

201
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,760
- They're in the kitchen now.\N- It's your house.

202
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,220
- If you don't like it, tell them to leave.\N- It doesn't work that way.

203
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,930
McCabe isn't screwing around.

204
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,390
First, the Angel Doll bullshit,\Nand now these Feds.

205
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,980
He's on edge and pissed.\NTwo things you don't want that guy to be.

206
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,610
You're my head of security.\NDo your fucking job.

207
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,250
Heard things been tough lately.

208
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,960
Don't worry, princess.

209
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,710
Cavalry's here.

210
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,300
Hot as hell, black as pitch.

211
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,840
Thank you.

212
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,800
You like the coffee?

213
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,560
It's okay.

214
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,100
It's from a feline's asshole.

215
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,060
Some posh brand Zachary likes.

216
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,270
They feed coffee beans to cats,

217
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,650
then dig through the litter box\Nafter they pass 'em through.

218
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,450
What for?

219
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,740
Something in their digestive system\Nimproves the taste.

220
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,910
It tastes like coffee.

221
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,450
Might want to leave the cat out of it.

222
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,250
You owe me 20 bucks.

223
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,420
I told you. He don't like pussy.

224
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,000
Speaking of pussy,

225
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,460
I've never been so jealous\Nof a fork in my life.

226
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,880
You like cream?

227
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,430
- I know where you can get some more.\N-  Mm-hmm.

228
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,890
Oui, de ta mère.

229
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,890
What did she say?

230
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,980
She said the cream came from your mother.

231
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,190
Probably 'cause she's a big fat cow.

232
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,860
So she's funny now?

233
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,070
You have any thoughts on dessert?

234
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,570
No, man.

235
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,570
I got diabetes.

236
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,210
A cat's asshole?

237
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,320
Hey, brother?

238
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,820
Can you take these cuffs off?

239
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,370
They're killing me, man.

240
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,870
Absolutely not.

241
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:21,790
Oh, come on, man.

242
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,790
They're killing me.

243
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,870
Oh, I mean, my wrists\Nhaven't hurt this bad

244
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,790
since I was 13 and I found\Nmy uncle's Elle MacPherson Playboy.

245
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,420
Jesus Christ.

246
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,800
Hey, look, man,\Nwe've been hanging out for days.

247
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,800
Watching TV,\Nshooting the shit like regular guys.

248
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,800
But then you got to feed me chow mein\Nlike I'm a baby bird.

249
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,100
It's fucking humiliating.

250
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,060
If you're not gonna let me\Neat like a regular guy and

251
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,150
just like take a break off these cuffs,

252
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,110
least you could do\Nis let me have a Chesterfield.

253
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,280
I told you there are regulations.

254
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,570
Come on, man.

255
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,280
None of me being here follows regulations.

256
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,450
- I hate the smoke.\N- Crack a window.

257
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,290
All it's gonna do is\Ntake seven minutes of my life, not yours.

258
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,660
Come on, brah.

259
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,420
Front right jacket pocket.

260
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,050
Come on, do me a solid.

261
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,380
Please.

262
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,640
Only once.

263
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,890
All right.

264
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,890
Only once.

265
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,020
And I never want to hear\Nabout a fucking cigarette ever again.

266
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,660
All right.

267
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,280
One time.

268
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,250
Make it count.

269
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,500
Understood?

270
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,570
Thanks for the smoke.

271
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,290
I hope you got good news.

272
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,120
Sounds like\Nit's the same as yours.

273
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,830
Those places were a waste of time.

274
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:30,870
Where are you now?

275
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,210
Stopped to gas up.

276
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,460
You're gassy enough.

277
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,550
Drop whatever's left\Nof whatever you're eating.

278
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,510
I'll order you a salad at the cabin.

279
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,160
Steven.

280
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,330
Steven! Steven?

281
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,160
Oh, my God.

282
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,450
Oh, my God! Steven?

283
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,580
Steven?

284
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,580
Steven?

285
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,920
Fuck!

286
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,530
No way you'd risk getting me killed

287
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,490
by calling unless it was\Nsomething really important.

288
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,120
Eliot's dead and the bodyguard's gone.

289
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,370
You got to get out of the there.

290
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,080
By now he already told Beck\Nthe kidnapping attempt was a fake.

291
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,120
If he had, Paulie would be up here\Nright now tearing my head off.

292
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,380
Does Cooper have his phone?

293
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,250
No, it was locked in the other room.

294
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,130
Uh, I'm guessing he just ran\Nout of here soon as he could.

295
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,630
Then he can't call Beck.

296
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,590
Well, he can go to a bar, use their phone.

297
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,090
You said Beck's number was unlisted.

298
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,470
How many numbers do you have memorized?

299
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,850
His only play is coming here in person.

300
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,260
How much time do I have?

301
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,060
I don't know...

302
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,230
Wait!

303
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,850
Wait, uh...

304
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,020
His smartwatch says\Nthat his heart rate spiked

305
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,820
and then stopped...

306
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,360
ten minutes ago.

307
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
Where's Villanueva?

308
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,070
He's headed back here.

309
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,280
Okay.

310
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,820
I'm gonna need his help\Nif I'm gonna intercept

311
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,280
the bodyguard before he gets to the house.

312
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,790
What-what reason\Nare you gonna give Beck for leaving?

313
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,660
I'm not gonna give it to him.

314
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,870
You are.

315
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,380
Reacher?

316
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,170
Get to the blind turn that leads\Nto Beck's house.

317
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,130
Pull over 40 yards south\Nand empty the car.

318
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,010
Make it as light as possible.

319
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,550
I'll be there as soon as I can.

320
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,720
What the hell's going on?

321
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,060
Bodyguard killed Eliot.

322
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,980
If you don't do exactly as I say,

323
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,060
the kid'll have died for nothing.

324
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,870
That's a big boy.

325
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,730
The landlines are all out, too.

326
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,730
What the hell is going on?

327
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,020
Someone must've cut the power.

328
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,360
Who?

329
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,360
Maybe the guys\NAngel Doll was working with.

330
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,780
We've killed a bunch of their people\Nin the past 24 hours.

331
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,450
Could be retribution.

332
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,110
Might be coming after your son.

333
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,660
Electric's down all over the property.

334
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,950
The gates open by default\Nwhen there's a power outage.

335
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,290
It's open?

336
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,460
Well, who the hell's watching it?

337
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,670
One of the new guys McCabe sent.

338
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,500
Well, get down there with them.\NWe might be going to war.

339
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,090
Fuck off. You ain't my boss.

340
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,750
No, McCabe is.

341
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,220
And you want to see what he'll do to you\Nif his operation is wiped out

342
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,550
and you're not at your post?

343
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,560
Okay, look,

344
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,560
I'm gonna go to the end of the road\Nthat leads to the property.

345
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,390
It's the only way in or out of here.

346
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,020
If anyone thinks they're coming in,\Nthey're gonna have to go through me first.

347
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,440
What's happening?

348
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,860
Go back to your room and lock the door.\NEverything will be fine.

349
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,320
No, Richard, come on down here with me.\NI'll keep an eye on you.

350
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,990
He's safer upstairs.

351
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,070
I want him where I can see him.

352
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,030
Richard, do what I say.

353
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,410
I don't know. It just happened\Na few minutes ago.

354
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,580
Well, I-I don't really think\Nthat's necessary, but...

355
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,630
All right.

356
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,500
Got it.

357
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,630
I'll do it now.

358
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,550
McCabe wants\Nthe entire staff searched.

359
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,680
Maid, cook, groundskeeper.

360
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,430
Grab the mechanic, too.\NToss all their rooms.

361
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,850
If there's another rat,\NMcCabe wants it caught.

362
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,140
Let's go.

363
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,650
- Get out of bed.

364
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,150
- Get out now. Let's go, come on.

365
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,490
- Get off me! What the hell is going on?\N- Downstairs.

366
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,570
- Downstairs now. Yeah, you too.\N- Get downstairs.

367
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,910
- Get down there.\N- For God's sake.

368
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,450
Now. Move your asses.

369
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,940
We don't have much time.

370
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,980
- Pull your car to the middle of the road.\N- Why?

371
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,030
We're gonna flip it over.

372
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,990
Of course we are.

373
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,590
Follow me.

374
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,180
We'll use the slope to our advantage.

375
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,050
Get under it and give it all you got.

376
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,720
- I don't think we can do this.\N- I'll do 90% of the work.

377
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,770
Just put your weight behind it.

378
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,520
When I say "lift," lift. Ready?

379
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,360
Lift.

380
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,190
Oh!

381
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,320
- Come on. Push!\N- I am pushing!

382
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,700
I bet if there were doughnuts underneath,

383
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,910
you'd be able to flip it.

384
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,660
Fuck you.

385
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,380
Okay.

386
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,810
What exactly is your plan?

387
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,520
This is the narrowest part of the road.\NNo way around.

388
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,560
He'll have to get out\Nof his car to help you.

389
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,560
Help me?

390
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,060
You'll be in the car.

391
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,900
Goddamn it.

392
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,850
What's so funny?

393
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,430
I'm supposed to retire\Nin five months.

394
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,690
I was gonna ride my desk out\Ntill the end of the year,

395
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,150
start hammering pension checks,

396
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,520
but when things went sideways for Duff...

397
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,940
Been with her since she was a boot.

398
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,570
Closest thing to a kid I'll ever have.

399
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,160
Now, I'm like every veteran cop\Nin every cop movie.

400
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,330
Inches from the gold watch,

401
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,250
but I'm gonna get killed when this guy\Ncomes flying around the corner

402
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,050
and plows right into my ass.

403
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,710
He'll hit the brakes\Nas soon as he rounds the corner.

404
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,840
If he's going 70, he'll come\Nto a complete stop in just over 490 feet.

405
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,350
We're 500 feet from the turn.

406
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,510
Ten feet to spare?

407
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,180
That's not much wiggle room.

408
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,810
Odds are he'll be going\Nunder 70 miles an hour on this road.

409
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,610
Promise you'll be fine.\NMath is never wrong.

410
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,900
What if he hits the brakes late?

411
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,530
Do your retirement payments\Ntransfer to your wife?

412
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,160
Asshole.

413
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,790
Shut up. I hear a car.

414
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,090
Shit!

415
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
What the hell?

416
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,490
This is for Eliot.

417
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,510
Good work.

418
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,430
I got to get back to Beck before\Nthey send someone to check on me.

419
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,890
Let's throw the guy in the trunk.

420
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,640
Hide the car in the brush.

421
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,400
I'll help you roll it over.

422
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,810
I got it.

423
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,650
I promised the car wouldn't hit you,\Ncan't stop a coronary.

424
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,990
Asshole.

425
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:52,200
Yes, well, it was a cold case,\Nseveral years old.

426
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,120
He was following up on an anonymous tip

427
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,460
on a Worcester drug ring,\Nand it looks like it was a setup.

428
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,050
Mr. Eliot, I just want you to know,\Nwe are not gonna rest

429
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,510
until we get every person\Nresponsible for what happened.

430
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:10,550
I-I'm sorry.\NMay I ask your name again, Agent?

431
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,270
Of course. It's Susan Duffy.

432
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,100
 I remember.

433
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,560
We met at the Christmas party.

434
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,070
M-Mr. Eliot, I, um...

435
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:26,820
Earlier today, I was in danger,\Nand Eliot warned me.

436
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,410
He saved my life.

437
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,040
Your son was an excellent agent, sir.

438
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,250
Thank you, Agent Duffy.

439
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,340
Hey.

440
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,380
The man\Nwho killed Eliot is dead.

441
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,180
Good. Now let's get the rest of them.

442
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,840
What will you tell the DEA?

443
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,850
 Same bullshit\NI told Eliot's father.

444
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,850
Should buy us some time, not much,

445
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,100
but hopefully enough to find Teresa.

446
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,980
When it's all over, I'll come clean.

447
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,650
It'll cost you your job.

448
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,150
Good. It should.

449
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,190
I owe you a thank-you.

450
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,990
 What for?

451
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,860
If you hadn't taken out the lights,\NI could've never left

452
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,570
and Cooper would've come home\Nand I'd be dead.

453
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,240
Saving the life of a good person\Nis a pretty low bar for praise.

454
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,580
Okay.

455
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,750
Pulling up to Beck's now. Be safe.

456
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,500
You stay safe, too, Reacher.

457
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,570
What's going on?

458
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:38,290
You tell me. What happened out there?

459
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,370
Nothing.

460
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,620
Heard over the radio,\Na drunk hit a power transformer,

461
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,500
took out the lights for half the county.

462
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,420
I didn't mean to cause undue alarm,

463
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,760
but with everything that's been happening,

464
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,170
better safe than sorry.

465
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,680
That's what the boss thought, too.

466
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,930
So, while you were gone,\Nwe searched the entire place.

467
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,180
Your boss is smart.

468
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,770
You find anything? Everything okay?

469
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,940
No.

470
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,690
It's not.

471
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,700
Turns out,

472
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,030
I let someone in my home

473
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,990
that's working with the Feds.

474
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,370
Well, you think you know someone, right?

475
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,370
You invite 'em into your home,

476
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,040
you shelter 'em,

477
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,380
you feed 'em.

478
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,630
You trust them with your family.

479
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,510
And how do they repay you?

480
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,840
With betrayal.

481
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:55,650
- This was found in the maid's room.\N- What the hell is that?

482
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,780
Some kind of phone.

483
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,330
She was giving out details\Nabout our business--

484
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,500
when the next delivery is happening,

485
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,040
approximate cargo size,

486
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,920
even who's gonna be\Nat my goddamn birthday party.

487
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,300
Fucking Judas was texting her people

488
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,630
every two weeks, and the latest entry

489
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,720
was ten days ago, so we got four days\Nbefore anyone's looking for her.

490
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,510
Who would be looking for her?

491
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,010
Fucking ATF, stupid.

492
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,180
Who else?

493
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,190
McCabe's gonna blame me for this.\NI hired her.

494
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,350
Let me talk to her. I was an M.P.

495
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,480
I know how to interrogate\Nand get information out of people.

496
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,280
If you want to talk to Frenchie,\Nyou're gonna need a Ouija board.

497
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,240
You killed her?

498
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,660
Not me.

499
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,780
I gave her a crack to the head\Nto get her to cooperate.

500
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,620
Oops.

501
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,330
You think that's funny?

502
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:49,080
Why are you so bent out of shape?\NYou fucking her?

503
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,540
I'm pissed 'cause you killed a source

504
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,130
before I had a chance\Nto get any information.

505
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,630
That's what I said.

506
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,630
It was a dumb move by a dumb man.

507
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,340
Do something about it.

508
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,020
See? It doesn't kill everybody.

509
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,540
Hey, Punch and Judy,\Nwe got work to do.

510
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,540
Move your ass.

511
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,690
Man, he rung your bell like school's out.

512
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,030
I warned you he was coming for you.

513
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,440
You got off lucky.\NHe could have killed your ass.

514
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,530
And I would've had\Nto dump the maid by myself.

515
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,700
By the way, keep your mouth shut

516
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,370
around the house staff\Nabout her being dead.

517
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,080
No one saw anything\Nbecause it happened in the kitchen.

518
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,170
We told everyone she was fired\Nfor stealing from Beck's business.

519
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,420
They don't know shit,\Nand we got to keep it that way.

520
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,470
Power's back.

521
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,010
Bet you feel like a jackass,

522
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,050
thinking someone was\Ngonna come kill us all

523
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,180
when the real danger\Nwas inside the house the whole time?

524
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,640
Go.

525
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,620
Look at what that big idiot did.

526
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,500
Okay, let's go flush her down.

527
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,250
This whole thing really\Nscrewed up my plans, you know?

528
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:01,050
I got me a boat down in Port Rome\Nthat I'm fixing up, The Sweet Marie.

529
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,380
I was gonna do a little fishing\Non Saturday.

530
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:07,140
Now that Angel Doll's dead,\NI'm gonna have to write new want ads

531
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,220
for a new maid\Nand upload it to all the job sites.

532
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,930
Barely know how to do that shit.

533
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,060
I'm not Steve Jobs.

534
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,810
Then I'm gonna have to\Ngo through all the résumés.

535
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,070
You know McCabe's\Ngonna be really up my ass

536
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,360
to do background checks on everyone.

537
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,030
This fucking snail-eater\Nreally ruined my weekend.

538
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,660
Good. Found your off switch.

539
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,800
You okay?

540
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,470
I'm fine.

541
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,520
I know you dumped Annette's body\Nin the ocean with Harley.

542
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,610
I had to.

543
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,990
I work for them.

544
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,110
I say "no," I'm the next one in the water.

545
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,030
You're afraid of Paulie.

546
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,490
I'm not afraid of him.

547
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,580
I just haven't solved him yet.

548
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,750
Big guys like that\Naren't usually that fast.

549
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,920
He took me by surprise.

550
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,550
Won't happen again.

551
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,090
It's okay to be scared of these guys.

552
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,260
My dad is.

553
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,140
So am I.

554
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,380
Reacher?

555
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,460
The maid was ATF.

556
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,090
She's gone.

557
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,510
They killed her.

558
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,220
Shit.

559
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,390
You're with DEA, maid's with the ATF.

560
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,220
It's Alphabet City in that place.

561
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,310
They're running guns, not drugs.

562
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,690
It all makes sense.

563
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:21,940
Beck met with Darien Prado.

564
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,860
International drug runners need lots\Nof high-end, untraceable weapons.

565
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,650
I didn't understand why Beck needed\Na mechanic for barely used cars,

566
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,450
but Quinn needs him to make sure

567
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,740
the weapons are in perfect working order\Nbefore selling 'em.

568
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,580
That's why I found that industrial\Nlubricant company on Angel Doll's laptop.

569
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,660
They purchase the oil in bulk,\Ntest the guns, grease 'em up.

570
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,080
It's white-glove service\Nwhen you buy from Quinn.

571
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,590
That's also why the dog\Ncouldn't sniff anything on that truck.

572
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:48,170
There were no drugs, just guns.

573
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,380
Quinn has that big sale coming up.

574
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,930
It's gonna be a shitload\Nof illegal firepower.

575
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,390
The question is, for who?

576
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,020
We already know they supply drug dealers.

577
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,520
There are lots of people who'd like\Nto get their hands

578
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,690
on what you saw in that warehouse--

579
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:05,480
militias, terrorists, warlords, cartels--

580
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,780
any number of buyers\Nfor any number of reasons.

581
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,030
None of 'em good.

582
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,120
You're being quiet.

583
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
Was thinking about the maid.

584
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,080
If they killed a Fed\Nwhen they knew she was a Fed,

585
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,580
what the hell could they do to Teresa?

586
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,310
- We've been summoned to the warehouse.\N- We?

587
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,020
Yeah. You and me, specifically.

588
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,350
Did you sleep last night?

589
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,810
No.

590
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,520
Well, an exhausted bodyguard's\Nno use to me.

591
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,400
What the hell is your problem?

592
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,780
No problem.

593
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,280
Let's go.

594
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,030
Reacher?

595
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,120
You still have the maid's blood\Non your hands.

596
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,200
Why don't you wash up\Nand get your shit together?

597
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,840
Hey. What's up?

598
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,010
I don't know exactly what's going on,\Nbut both Beck and I have been

599
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,350
summoned to Bizarre Bazaar.

600
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,310
Only one person has the power to do that.

601
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,770
You're gonna see Quinn.

602
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,890
He wants to talk to you for some reason.

603
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,100
Or maybe we take one step inside\Nhis warehouse

604
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:29,480
and meet a firing squad for letting\Na federal agent infiltrate his operation.

605
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,190
Well, Beck I get, he hired her.

606
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,400
- But why you?\N- I'm his head of security.

607
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:36,620
And Quinn's a psychopath.

608
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,120
Don't go.

609
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,540
Don't have a choice.

610
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,250
At least keep the phone on in your pocket.

611
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,410
Villy and I will head over there,\Nstake the place out.

612
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,040
If you get compromised,\Nwe'll head in, back you up.

613
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,000
I'll be surrounded by trained killers.

614
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,050
So, I just leave you in there\Nto get killed?

615
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:53,760
I don't care what his plans are for me.

616
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,510
I have plans for him.

617
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,050
Negative.

618
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,010
He got past me in Portland and Virginia.

619
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,060
I get near him, it's not happening again.

620
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,730
What, so you kill him\Nand try to shoot your way out?

621
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:06,390
He could recognize me,\Nand I might not have a choice.

622
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,810
And he might have no idea\Nwho the fuck you are.

623
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,400
He had amnesia, remember?

624
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,940
Maybe he did.

625
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,400
Maybe he faked it.

626
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,780
Reacher, it's suicide. And homicide.

627
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,950
You kill Quinn,\Nthen you're killing Teresa too,

628
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,950
'cause for all we know, Quinn's\Nthe only person who knows where she is.

629
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,540
- Someone on his crew will know.\N- Even if someone in his crew

630
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,750
has her location, they'll likely kill her

631
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,130
after they find out\Nthere's a third infiltrator in the mix.

632
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:31,290
They'll cut their losses,\Nclean up their mess and move on.

633
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,550
Duffy.

634
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,630
She's already dead.

635
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,970
Fuck you.

636
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,260
They found out the maid was undercover,

637
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,510
and she was dead within minutes.

638
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,760
There's no way they haven't already\Nstarted cleaning up their mess.

639
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,100
She's gone.

640
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,560
You there?

641
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,650
Duffy, I got to go.

642
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,360
I'll leave my phone on.

643
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,280
Shit.

644
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,550
You get called in like this a lot?

645
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,260
No.

646
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,470
McCabe normally comes to my house\Nand walks in and out like it's his.

647
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,970
You think we're gonna\Nwalk in and out today?

648
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,270
Or just in?

649
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,520
I don't know.

650
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,990
Ooh. Here we go.

651
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,920
How's the face?

652
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:33,330
You ready to meet the boss?

653
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,130
Yes.

654
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,300
